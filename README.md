Description:
This is a fun and interactive number guessing game where the player is tasked with guessing a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 attempts to guess the number correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback, telling the player if their guess is too high or too low. Additionally, the game offers hints such as "Warmer" or "Colder" to indicate if the player's guess is getting closer to or farther from the correct number.
